### Usage notes

`rfid_tag_parser.py` is used as the rich tag parser. Entry point:
`parse_tag(raw_bytes_or_blocks, uid_hex)`. The local copy also accepts an optional
trace callback so NFC debug logging can follow parser decisions without adding a
dependency on this project to the vendor module.

`lameandboard_spoolman.py` is used by the Spoolman auto-create path. The NFC adapter
instantiates the vendored `SpoolmanClient` with the resolved Spoolman URL and timeout,
then calls `auto_create_spool(meta, uid_hex=None)`.

Passing `uid_hex=None` is intentional: it lets the vendored helper create or find the
vendor, filament, and spool from tag metadata without writing the upstream
`rfid_uid_N` multi-slot UID fields. After the spool is created, this project patches
the UID onto the newly-created spool using its configured single Spoolman extra field
(`spoolman_rfid_key`, default `rfid_tag`) through the local NFC Spoolman adapter.

If that UID patch fails, the read is treated as unresolved so the system does not lose
the UID-to-spool link.

### Updating

A GitHub Action runs weekly and opens a PR automatically if upstream changes either file.
To update manually:

```bash
git fetch lameandboard
git show lameandboard/main:extras/rfid_tag_parser.py > klippy/extras/nfc_gates/vendor/rfid_tag_parser.py
git show lameandboard/main:extras/spoolman_client.py > klippy/extras/nfc_gates/vendor/lameandboard_spoolman.py
```

Review the diff against `nfc_manager.py` adapter code before committing, then update
`upstream_commit` and `synced_date` above.
