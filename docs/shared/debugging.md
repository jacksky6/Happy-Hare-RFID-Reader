## NFC_GATE_STATUS Command

Run from the Klipper console (Mainsail / Fluidd terminal) at any time:

```
NFC_GATE_STATUS
```

**SPI / RC522 output** (one `[nfc_gates]` section, all gates in one command):
```
NFC gate status — 5 gates, poll 30s, absent threshold 3:
  Gate 0: spool 1042    UID A3F200CC
  Gate 1: empty
  Gate 2: spool 207     UID B1D4A209
  Gate 3: empty
  Gate 4: READER FAILED (check wiring)
```

**I2C / PN532 output** (one `[nfc_gate laneN]` section per gate):
```
NFC gate status  (4 gates configured):
  Gate 0  [lane0]:  spool 1042    UID A3F200CC
  Gate 1  [lane1]:  empty
  Gate 2  [lane2]:  spool 207     UID B1D4A209
  Gate 3  [lane3]:  tag A3F200CC  (no spool ID — write one with NFC Tools)
```

This reflects the last poll result — it is not a live read. To force an immediate
read, reduce `poll_interval` to `5` in the config and restart Klipper.

## Klipper Log

All NFC events are written to `klippy.log`:

```bash
# Follow live
tail -f ~/printer_data/logs/klippy.log | grep nfc_gate

# Search for gate changes only
grep "state change\|spool.*detected\|spool removed" ~/printer_data/logs/klippy.log

# Show the last 100 NFC lines
grep nfc_gate ~/printer_data/logs/klippy.log | tail -100
```

---

## Debug Verbosity

Set `debug:` in your config section to control log detail.

| Value | Output |
|---|---|
| `0` | Errors and warnings only |
| `1` | Major events: poll cycles, tag detected/removed, state changes **(default)** |
| `2` | Full trace: every register read/write (SPI) or I2C frame (PN532), FIFO contents, CRC values |

**SPI / RC522** — set inside `[nfc_gates]`:
```ini
[nfc_gates]
debug: 2
```

**I2C / PN532** — set inside any or all `[nfc_gate]` sections:
```ini
[nfc_gate lane0]
debug: 2
```

Restart Klipper after changing. Revert to `debug: 1` after debugging (debug=2 is very chatty at a 30 s poll interval with 5 gates).

## Expected Log Output at debug: 1

### SPI / RC522 — successful startup and poll cycle

```
nfc_gates: connected to MCU 'nfc_pico', initialising 5 gates (poll=30s, absent_threshold=3, debug=1)
nfc_gates: gate 0 init — soft-resetting RC522
nfc_gates: gate 0 RC522 init OK (TxControl=0x83)
nfc_gates: gate 1 RC522 init OK (TxControl=0x83)
...
nfc_gates: 5/5 readers initialised
nfc_gates: polling thread started
nfc_gates: poll cycle — checking 5 gate(s)
nfc_gates: gate 0 — no tag (miss_count=1)
nfc_gates: gate 0 read_tag — tag detected UID=A3F200CC
nfc_gates: gate 0 — state change: CHANGED (uid=A3F200CC spool=1042)
```

### I2C / PN532 — successful startup

```
nfc_gate: [lane0] connected — gate=0, poll=30s, absent_threshold=3, debug=1
nfc_gate: [lane0] PN532 reader OK
nfc_gate: [lane0] polling thread started
nfc_gate: [lane0] gate 0 — no tag (miss 1)
nfc_gate: [lane0] gate 0 — CHANGED uid=A3F200CC spool=1042
```

## Reducing Poll Interval for Testing

Change `poll_interval` and `absent_threshold` for faster feedback during setup.
Do this in the config file and restart Klipper — no hardware changes needed.

```ini
# Fast testing settings — restore to production values when done
poll_interval:    5    # check every 5 seconds instead of 30
absent_threshold: 1    # report removal after first missed poll
```

Production values: `poll_interval: 30` / `absent_threshold: 3`
(3 missed polls = ~90 seconds absence before REMOVED fires — prevents false removals from RF glitches.)

## Simulating Events Without Hardware

Use the Klipper console to test your Happy Hare macro integration directly,
without waiting for a physical tag:

```
# Simulate spool placed on gate 0
_NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED GATE=0 SPOOL_ID=1042 UID=A3F200CC

# Simulate spool removed from gate 0
_NFC_SPOOL_REMOVED GATE=0

# Simulate unwritten tag
_NFC_TAG_NO_SPOOL GATE=2 UID=DEADBEEF
```

Verify that `MMU_GATE_MAP` updates correctly in Happy Hare before deploying hardware.
