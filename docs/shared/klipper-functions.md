## Startup — Happy Hare Cache Seed

When Klipper connects, NFC_Manager runs this sequence for each lane automatically:

```
klippy:connect  →  _handle_connect()  →  schedule _delayed_init() (2 s)

_delayed_init()
  1. Initialise PN532 reader
  2. Read Happy Hare gate map  →  seed this lane's local cache
  3. Start background polling  (if startup_polling: 1)
```

**Step 2 is the key one.** NFC_Manager calls `mmu.get_status()` directly to read `gate_spool_id` for this gate. The result is stored as a one-shot seed. On the very first poll:

- Tag resolves to the **same spool** as the HH seed → cache updated silently, **no dispatch** (HH already knows)
- Tag resolves to a **different spool** → `_NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED` dispatched normally (spool was swapped while Klipper was down)
- No tag present → seed kept until the first successful tag read

The seed is always cleared after the first `CHANGED` event — it fires at most once per startup per lane.

**Console output at startup:**
```
✅ NFC[lane0]: reader ready.  HH seed: spool_id=42  Startup polling is enabled; first poll in 0.0s.
✅ NFC[lane1]: reader ready.  HH reports gate empty  Run NFC GATE=1 READ=1 to start polling.
```

**If Happy Hare wasn't ready** when the NFC init ran (rare — both init at `klippy:connect`), the seed step is skipped and all first-poll reads dispatch normally. Run `NFC_HH_SYNC_CACHE` to manually re-seed.

---

## `NFC_HH_SYNC_CACHE`

Re-seeds all NFC lane caches from the current Happy Hare gate map. Use this any time you want to re-align NFC state with HH without restarting Klipper.

```gcode
NFC_HH_SYNC_CACHE
```

The macro reads `printer.mmu.gate_spool_id` for each gate and calls `NFC GATE=N HH_SYNC=1 SPOOL_ID=<n>` per lane. The Python side receives the spool_id and sets the seed. On the next poll for each lane, if the physical tag matches the seed, the dispatch is suppressed.

**When to use:**
- Happy Hare wasn't fully initialised when the PN532 init ran and the startup seed was skipped
- You manually changed the HH gate map and want NFC to treat the current state as baseline
- After loading filament manually (without NFC) and you don't want a spurious CHANGED on the next poll

---

## Normal Operation

### `NFC_STATUS`

Shows the NFC_Manager's last known state for every gate. This is an in-memory snapshot — it is not a live I2C read.

```gcode
NFC_STATUS
```

Example output:
```
NFC gate status  (5 gates configured):
  Gate 0:  empty   [not polling]  [HH: empty]
  Gate 1:  empty   [polling]  [HH: empty]
  Gate 4:  spool 43     UID 04456192D32A81   [polling]  [HH: spool 43]
```

---

### `NFC GATE=<n> STATUS=1`

Same as `NFC_STATUS` but for a single lane.

```gcode
NFC GATE=4 STATUS=1
```

---

### `NFC GATE=<n> INIT=1`

Runs the PN532 initialization sequence: wakeup → `GetFirmwareVersion` → `SAMConfiguration`.

```gcode
NFC GATE=0 INIT=1
```

**When to use:** After first wiring, after a failed startup, or after flashing lane MCU firmware.

Expected success:
```
NFC[lane0]: reader OK
```

If this fails, see [Troubleshooting](../i2c-pn532/troubleshooting.md).

---

### `NFC GATE=<n> SCAN=1`

Reads the PN532 hardware once and prints the raw tag UID. Does not look up Spoolman and does not update Happy Hare.

```gcode
NFC GATE=0 SCAN=1
```

**When to use:**
- Getting a UID to register in Spoolman
- Confirming a reader can physically see a tag
- Checking whether a wiring or mode problem is fixed

---

### `NFC GATE=<n> JOG_SCAN=1`

Starts the scan-and-jog sequence on demand, identical to the automatic pre-load trigger that fires when Happy Hare parks filament at the gate.

```gcode
NFC GATE=0 JOG_SCAN=1
```

**What it does:** Selects the gate, then jogs the filament forward in `scan_jog_mm` increments, reading the NFC tag after each step. When the tag is found it rewinds to the parked position. If the lane's Happy Hare Bowden calibration length is reached without a read, it rewinds and exits scan mode.

**Preconditions** (same as the automatic path — the command checks all of these and reports a plain-language error if any fail):

| Check | What it guards |
|---|---|
| PN532 not in failed state | Reader must have initialised successfully |
| No active print | Scan cannot move filament during a print |
| Happy Hare `action == idle` | HH must not be loading, unloading, or homing |
| No other gate currently scanning | Only one gate may hold the MMU at a time |

**When to use:**
- Filament was loaded manually and the automatic trigger didn't fire (e.g. `scan_enabled: False`, or the 0→1 edge was missed)
- Retrying a scan after a failed automatic attempt
- Testing scan-jog behaviour without physically reloading filament

Expected success output:
```
NFC[lane0]: scan-jog started for gate 0 (step=50mm  max=600mm  interval=2.0s)
NFC[0] - moved 50.0mm  total 50.0mm / 600.0mm
NFC[0]: rewinding 50.0mm
```

If a precondition fails:
```
NFC[lane0]: Happy Hare is busy (action=loading) — wait for idle before starting scan-jog
```

---

### `NFC GATE=<n> POLL=1`

Runs one complete cycle of the NFC manager pipeline:

1. PN532 reads the UID
2. NFC_Manager checks if the UID is new, the same, or absent
3. If new: SpoolmanClient looks up the spool ID
4. Gate state updates
5. If state changed: dispatches `_NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED`, `_NFC_SPOOL_REMOVED`, or `_NFC_TAG_NO_SPOOL`

```gcode
NFC GATE=0 POLL=1
```

**When to use:** Testing the complete pipeline end-to-end, or verifying a specific tag is registered correctly.

Expected output (registered tag):
```
NFC gate 0: spool 42 detected (UID 04AABBCCDD). Sending to Happy Hare.
```

Expected output (unregistered tag):
```
NFC gate 0: tag UID 04AABBCCDD is not registered in Spoolman.
Open the spool record in Spoolman, set the 'rfid_tag' extra field to: 04AABBCCDD
```

---

### `NFC GATE=<n> APPLY=1`

Forces the lane's cached spool assignment through to Happy Hare immediately. Does not read the PN532, does not query Spoolman — it just dispatches:

```gcode
_NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED GATE=<gate> SPOOL_ID=<cached_id> UID=<cached_uid>
```

```gcode
NFC GATE=0 APPLY=1
```

**When to use:** When a poll or polling cycle already resolved a spool, but Happy Hare didn't update (e.g. it was in a locked state during the scan). If you get "no cached spool_id", run `POLL=1` first.

---

### `NFC GATE=<n> CLEAR_CACHE=1`

Clears the lane's cached spool ID and forces a fresh Spoolman lookup on the next tag read.

```gcode
NFC GATE=0 CLEAR_CACHE=1
```

Clears:
1. The lane's cached spool ID
2. The SpoolmanClient UID cache
3. The PN532 driver's in-memory current-card cache

On the next poll, the full `(uid, spool_id)` combination is re-evaluated:

- **Same UID, same spool in Spoolman** → cache refreshed silently, no dispatch
- **Same UID, different spool in Spoolman** → `_NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED` dispatched with the new spool

This is the correct way to force a re-read after editing a spool's UID registration in Spoolman.

`CLEAR=1` is accepted as a shorthand.

---

### `NFC GATE=<n> HH_SYNC=1 SPOOL_ID=<n>`

Seeds this lane's cache with a spool_id from Happy Hare's gate map. On the next poll, if the physical tag resolves to that spool_id, the dispatch is suppressed (HH already knows).

```gcode
NFC GATE=0 HH_SYNC=1 SPOOL_ID=42
```

This command is normally called automatically by the `NFC_HH_SYNC_CACHE` macro — you won't need it directly in normal operation. Use `NFC_HH_SYNC_CACHE` to sync all lanes at once.

---

### `NFC GATE=<n> READ=1` / `READ=0`

Starts or stops background timer polling on one lane.

```gcode
NFC GATE=0 READ=1    ; start polling
NFC GATE=0 READ=0    ; stop polling
```

While polling is running, the lane runs `POLL=1` automatically every `poll_interval` seconds (default: 30). Macro dispatches happen automatically when gate state changes.

---

## Background Polling Setup

For production use, you want all lanes polling automatically. There are two ways to start polling:

**Manually after boot** (default — useful during setup):
```gcode
NFC GATE=0 READ=1
NFC GATE=1 READ=1
NFC GATE=2 READ=1
NFC GATE=3 READ=1
```

**Automatically on boot** (for set-and-forget operation): Add `startup_polling: 1` to each lane in `nfc_reader_hw.cfg`. Stagger the startup delays so all readers don't poll at the same moment:

```ini
[nfc_gate lane0]
startup_polling:    1
startup_poll_delay: 0.0

[nfc_gate lane1]
startup_polling:    1
startup_poll_delay: 2.0

[nfc_gate lane2]
startup_polling:    1
startup_poll_delay: 4.0

[nfc_gate lane3]
startup_polling:    1
startup_poll_delay: 6.0
```

---

## Event Macros

These macros live in `nfc_macros.cfg` and are called automatically by NFC_Manager when gate state changes. You don't call these manually during normal operation, but you can call them directly to test the Happy Hare handoff without hardware.

### `_NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED`

Fires when a tag UID resolves to a Spoolman spool and the gate state changed.

```gcode
_NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED GATE=<gate> SPOOL_ID=<id> UID=<uid>
```

Parameters:
- `GATE` — Happy Hare gate number (integer, matches `mmu_gate` in config)
- `SPOOL_ID` — Spoolman spool ID (integer)
- `UID` — NFC tag UID (hex string)

Default behavior:
```gcode
MMU_GATE_MAP GATE={gate} SPOOLID={spool_id} AVAILABLE=1 SYNC=1 QUIET=1
MMU_GATE_MAP GATE={gate} APPLY=1
```

This calls Happy Hare's `MMU_GATE_MAP` to update the gate map. `AVAILABLE=1` marks the gate as having filament loaded and ready. `SYNC=1` lets Happy Hare push the update to Spoolman. `APPLY=1` applies the updated map immediately.

---

### `_NFC_SPOOL_REMOVED`

Fires after a previously-detected spool is absent for `absent_threshold` consecutive polls.

```gcode
_NFC_SPOOL_REMOVED GATE=<gate>
```

Parameters:
- `GATE` — Happy Hare gate number

Default behavior:
```gcode
MMU_GATE_MAP GATE={gate} SPOOLID=-1 AVAILABLE=0 SYNC=1 QUIET=1
MMU_GATE_MAP GATE={gate} APPLY=1
```

Clears the gate in Happy Hare's gate map. `AVAILABLE=0` marks the gate as empty. `APPLY=1` applies the change immediately.

The macro also checks `printer.mmu.action` — if the MMU is mid-load, unload, or homing, the removal is silently ignored to avoid clearing the gate while filament is actively moving.

---

### `_NFC_TAG_NO_SPOOL`

Fires when a tag UID is detected but no matching spool is found in Spoolman.

```gcode
_NFC_TAG_NO_SPOOL GATE=<gate> UID=<uid>
```

Parameters:
- `GATE` — Happy Hare gate number
- `UID` — the unrecognized tag UID

Default behavior: prints a message to the console with the UID and instructions to register it.

**Optional:** If you want unregistered tags to clear the Happy Hare gate instead of just logging, add this line to the macro body:
```gcode
MMU_GATE_MAP GATE={gate} SPOOLID=-1 SYNC=1 QUIET=1
```

---

## Testing the Happy Hare Handoff Without Hardware

You can test whether the macro-to-Happy-Hare pipeline works by calling the event macros directly:

```gcode
_NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED GATE=0 SPOOL_ID=42 UID=04AABBCCDD
```

If Happy Hare updates correctly, the pipeline from macro inward is working. If it doesn't, check:
- The macro body in `nfc_macros.cfg`
- Whether `MMU_GATE_MAP GATE=... SPOOLID=... AVAILABLE=1 SYNC=1 QUIET=1` is the right syntax for your Happy Hare version
- Whether Happy Hare is in a state that accepts gate map changes (e.g. not mid-print with locks active)

```gcode
_NFC_SPOOL_REMOVED GATE=0
_NFC_TAG_NO_SPOOL GATE=0 UID=04AABBCCDD
```

---

## Customizing the Macros

The event macros are in `~/printer_data/config/nfc/nfc_macros.cfg`. Edit them to match your Happy Hare version.

**All Happy Hare commands must stay inside `nfc_macros.cfg`** — do not put `MMU_GATE_MAP` or other Happy Hare commands in Python. This keeps Happy Hare-facing behavior visible and editable in config without touching Python code.

### Happy Hare commands used by the defaults

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `MMU_GATE_MAP GATE=<n> SPOOLID=<id> AVAILABLE=1 SYNC=1 QUIET=1` | Assign a spool to a gate, mark it available, and sync to Spoolman |
| `MMU_GATE_MAP GATE=<n> APPLY=1` | Apply the current gate map immediately |
| `MMU_GATE_MAP GATE=<n> SPOOLID=-1 AVAILABLE=0 SYNC=1 QUIET=1` | Clear a gate, mark it empty, and sync to Spoolman |

The default macros are designed for Happy Hare with `spoolman_support: push`. `SYNC=1` tells Happy Hare to push the local gate map change to Spoolman. If your Happy Hare version uses different command names or parameters, update the macro body.

## Expert: Low-Level Debug Commands

These commands expose raw PN532 I2C bus access for bring-up debugging. They are hidden by default — enable with `low_level_debug: True` in `nfc_reader.cfg`.

> [!WARNING]
> Low-level commands bypass the normal state machine. Sending the wrong sequence can leave the PN532 in a state where normal polling fails until it is restarted. Use only during manual bring-up. Set `low_level_debug: False` before printing.

See [Expert: Low-Level I2C Debugging](expert-low-level-i2c-debugging.md) for the complete step-by-step bring-up sequence.
