# How It Works

## Startup — Boot Sequence

When Klipper connects, each lane goes through this sequence before polling begins:

```
klippy:connect
  └─ NFC_Manager registers commands
  └─ schedules _delayed_init()  (2 s delay — lets I2C and HH settle)

_delayed_init()
  └─ initialises PN532 reader
  └─ reads Happy Hare gate map  ← seeds local lane cache from HH state
  └─ starts background polling  (if startup_polling: 1)
```

### Why seed from Happy Hare?

After a Klipper restart the NFC lane cache is empty — but Happy Hare already knows which spool is in each gate from its own persisted state. Without seeding, the first poll would detect the tag, resolve it through Spoolman, and fire `_NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED` — redundantly telling Happy Hare something it already knows. With seeding, that first poll is absorbed silently.

If the physical spool was swapped while Klipper was down, the resolved spool_id won't match the seed, and `_NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED` dispatches normally.

### Startup console output

```
✅ NFC[lane0]: reader ready.  HH seed: spool_id=42  Startup polling is enabled; first poll in 0.0s.
✅ NFC[lane1]: reader ready.  HH reports gate empty  Run NFC GATE=1 READ=1 to start polling.
```

The seed is one-shot — it fires at most once per lane per boot, on the first `CHANGED` event. If Happy Hare wasn't ready when the NFC init ran, the seed step is skipped and a manual `NFC_HH_SYNC_CACHE` re-syncs all lanes.

## Per-Poll Flow

Tags are never written to. The NFC tag's factory UID is stored as a Spoolman extra field (`rfid_tag` by default). On every poll:

```
PN532 reads tag UID (or detects absence)
        │
        ▼
SpoolmanClient resolves UID → spool_id
(in-memory cache if fresh · HTTP query if expired or cleared)
        │
        ▼
NFC_Manager compares (uid, spool_id) against the lane cache
Both must match to be considered unchanged
        │
        ▼
State changed?
  ├─ New / re-assigned spool  →  _NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED  GATE=n  SPOOL_ID=id  UID=uid
  ├─ Tag absent (threshold)   →  _NFC_SPOOL_REMOVED  GATE=n
  └─ UID not in Spoolman      →  _NFC_TAG_NO_SPOOL   GATE=n  UID=uid
        │
        ▼
nfc_macros.cfg calls MMU_GATE_MAP ... to Happy Hare
```

The `(uid, spool_id)` combination check means that if the same physical tag is re-registered to a different spool in Spoolman, the change is detected on the next poll after the cache expires (or after `CLEAR_CACHE=1`).

## Scan-and-Jog Flow

When a spool is loaded, the NFC tag is on the hub face — it may be pointing any direction. The scan-jog loop rotates the spool until the tag comes within read range of the PN532 antenna.

### Trigger

The poll tick runs the gate-status edge check on every cycle. When all conditions are met, scan mode starts and the poll timer parks itself at `NEVER` for the duration.

```
_poll_timer_event  (every poll_interval seconds)
  └─ reads HH gate_status[N]  (Python dict — no I2C)
  └─ gate_status was 0, is now 1?
       AND  HH action == idle?
       AND  not printing?
       AND  no other gate currently scanning?
         └─ YES → _start_scan_mode()  →  poll timer parks at NEVER
         └─ NO  → continue normal polling
```

Initialization sets `_prev_gate_status = -1` so a cold-start with status already at 1 (from a previous session) does not trigger scan mode — only a fresh 0→1 transition fires it.

### Scan loop

```
_scan_step_event  (after each jog chunk completes)
  └─ print started?  →  rewind and exit
  └─ _poll()
       └─ tag found?  →  _finish_scan()
            └─ dispatch spool to Happy Hare (already done inside _poll)
            └─ MMU_SELECT_GATE GATE=N + MMU_UNLOAD restore=0  (rewind to parked)
            └─ resume poll timer
  └─ scan_mm_total >= lane Bowden length?  →  rewind and exit (no tag found)
  └─ MMU_SELECT_GATE GATE=N + MMU_TEST_MOVE MOVE=scan_jog_mm  (advance one step)
  └─ reschedule after scan_jog_mm / gear_short_move_speed
```

`_poll()` during a scan step is identical to a normal poll — I2C read, Spoolman lookup, `GateState.process_read`, macro dispatch. The only difference is that `GateState.miss_count` does not increment on a no-read during scan (a blank read while the spool rotates is not an absence event).

### Class-level scan lock

All lane instances share one class variable, `NFCGate._active_scan_gate`. Because Klipper's reactor is single-threaded, reads and writes are atomic with respect to timer callbacks — no mutex needed. Only one gate may scan at a time; a second gate that detects a 0→1 edge while the lock is held re-arms its pending flag and retries on the next poll tick.

## System Layers

Each layer owns one responsibility and must not reach across the boundary.

| Layer | File | Owns | Does not own |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PN532Driver** | `pn532_driver.py` | PN532 wire protocol, I2C frames, UID extraction | Spoolman, gate policy, Happy Hare |
| **SpoolmanClient** | `spoolman_client.py` | UID → spool record lookup and TTL cache | Gate state, lane assignment, MMU commands |
| **NFC_Manager** | `nfc_manager.py` | Gate state machine, change/remove decisions, macro dispatch, HH seed | PN532 protocol details, Spoolman HTTP |
| **nfc_macros.cfg** | config file | Happy Hare-facing GCode calls | NFC reads, Spoolman lookups |

---

## Macro Dispatch Events

NFC_Manager fires exactly one of these on a state change. They live in `nfc_macros.cfg` and are the only place Happy Hare commands are called.

| Macro | When | Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `_NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED` | New tag UID resolves to a Spoolman spool | `GATE`, `SPOOL_ID`, `UID` |
| `_NFC_SPOOL_REMOVED` | Tag absent for `absent_threshold` consecutive polls | `GATE` |
| `_NFC_TAG_NO_SPOOL` | Tag read but UID not registered in Spoolman | `GATE`, `UID` |

The default macro body for `_NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED`:
```gcode
MMU_GATE_MAP GATE={gate} SPOOLID={spool_id} AVAILABLE=1 SYNC=1 QUIET=1
MMU_GATE_MAP GATE={gate} APPLY=1
```

You can edit `nfc_macros.cfg` to match your Happy Hare version without touching any Python.
