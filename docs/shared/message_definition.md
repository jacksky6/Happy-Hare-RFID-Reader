# Message Definitions

[← Commands](klipper-functions.md) | [Shared Reader](shared-reader.md)

This page defines NFC messages that may appear in the Fluidd/Mainsail console
and, when applicable, the matching `nfc_reader.log` entry.

`nfc_reader.log` lines use this format:

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm LEVEL    <message>
```

Console prefixes are used consistently:

- `💥` means NFC tried the operation and it failed.
- `⚠️` means NFC skipped, ignored, or warned but kept the system recoverable.
- `⛔` means an action was blocked by a safety/precondition check.
- `[OK]` means the requested action completed.
- `[OK]` means a tag was found/read successfully.
- `🔍` means scan-jog started.
- `⏪` means scan-jog is rewinding.

Warnings and errors are also forwarded to `klippy.log`. Info/debug records stay
in `nfc_reader.log` unless the code explicitly mirrors them to the console.
When `console_output: true`, logger messages at or above `console_log_level` may
also appear on screen prefixed with `NFC:`.

## Common Messages

These apply to both per-lane readers and the shared reader.

commands and scan-jog.

## Low-Level Debug Messages

Low-level PN532 debug output is available only when `low_level_debug: true` is
configured. These messages are command-output probes and are intentionally not
normal workflow events.

| Case | Console message | `nfc_reader.log` |
|---|---|---|
| Low-level debug disabled | `NFC[<name>]: low_level_debug is disabled in config` | Console command output only |
| Reader lacks debug support | `NFC[<name>]: reader does not support low-level debug` | Console command output only |
| Polling paused for debug | `NFC[<name>]: polling paused for low-level PN532 debug` | Console command output only |
| Low-level debug failed | `NFC[<name>]: low-level debug failed: <error>` | Console command output only |
| Raw write | `NFC[<name>]: <op> WRITE before: <hex>` then `NFC[<name>]: <op> WRITE after: OK` | Console command output only |
| Raw read | `NFC[<name>]: <op> READ before: <n> byte(s)` then `NFC[<name>]: <op> READ after: <hex>` | Console command output only |
| Ready result | `NFC[<name>]: READY result: ready (0x01)`, `busy (0x00)`, or `unknown status 0x<value>` | Console command output only |
| ACK result | `NFC[<name>]: ACK result: valid PN532 ACK`, `invalid, expected 00 00 FF 00 FF 00`, or related probe guidance | Console command output only |
| Parsed response | `NFC[<name>]: Firmware parsed: ...`, `SAM response parsed: OK`, or `Passive response parsed header: OK` | Console command output only |
| Next suggested step | `NFC[<name>]: NEXT: NFC GATE=<#> <args>` | Console command output only |
