# Happy Hare RFID/NFC Reader

NFC spool identification for Happy Hare. Use one NFC reader on each EMU lane, one shared reader inside the MMU body, or both. PN532 remains the default reader; PN7160, RC522, and PN5180 are available with `reader_type: pn7160`, `rc522`, and `pn5180`.

This is a system-level Klipper integration, not a plug-and-play appliance. It touches Klipper extras, Happy Hare macros, lane MCU firmware, I2C wiring, Spoolman, and optional LED effects. If you are not comfortable recovering from a Klipper config error, reflashing lane MCUs, and reading logs, expect a learning curve.

## Why This Project Is Different

Most DIY spool RFID/NFC systems put a small controller such as an ESP32 near the
reader and report tags over WiFi, MQTT, or another side channel. Others wire the
reader back to the host Raspberry Pi, which often means long SDA/SCL or USB runs
through the printer.

This project keeps the reader inside the MMU wiring domain. Each NFC reader is
connected directly to an existing Klipper MCU I2C bus, usually the MMU board or
the per-lane board inside the MMU. Klipper talks to that MCU, and the plugin
integrates the result with Happy Hare and Spoolman.

Practical hardware choices:

- **EMU / one board per lane:** per-lane readers are a natural fit. Each lane has
  its own MCU/I2C bus, so PN532 and PN7160 are both valid choices.
- **Other B-style multi-material systems with one MMU board:** PN7160 is usually
  the better choice for multiple readers on one bus because it has four
  selectable I2C addresses (`40-43` / `0x28-0x2B`). That matches many four-color
  MMU layouts.
- **Single shared reader:** PN532, PN7160, RC522, or PN5180 can be mounted
  inside the MMU body and used as a tap-before-loading reader. PN5180 is the
  SPI option when SLIX2 (ISO15693/Type-5) support is required.

For EMU installations, the printable [LED holder for the EMU NFC reader](https://www.printables.com/model/1783248-led-holder-for-emu-nfc-reader/files)
provides the NFC-reader mounting hardware. The matching STEP source is included
in [`NFC Mounting Bracket/`](NFC%20Mounting%20Bracket/).

## Virtual Endstop — How Scan-Jog Finds the Tag

Per-lane installs register each lane's NFC reader as a real Klipper/Happy Hare
homing endstop (`mmu_nfc_endstop.py`, `[mmu_nfc_endstop laneN]`) — no extra
hardware or wiring, it borrows the reader the matching `[nfc_gate laneN]`
section already owns. When scan-jog searches for the tag, the forward search
is a genuine Klipper homing move (`ENDSTOP=nfc_lane<N>`) that stops the
instant the tag is detected, instead of jogging a fixed chunk and polling
afterward and hoping the tag was somewhere in that chunk. This is generated
automatically for every enabled lane by `install.sh` — there is nothing extra
to configure. See [How It Works](docs/shared/how-it-works.md) for the full
scan loop and [Configuration Reference](docs/shared/configuration.md) for the
`[mmu_nfc_endstop laneN]` keys.

The same configuration supports Happy Hare V3 and V4. The plugin registers
the software endstop on V3's shared gear rail or on the V4 drive selected by
the reader's `mmu_gate`. Lane and endstop section names are only labels; the
`nfc_gate` reference and `mmu_gate` value provide the actual binding, including
multi-unit installations.

## Operating Modes

| Mode | Hardware | Best For | Flow |
|---|---|---|---|
| Per-lane readers | One NFC reader per EMU gate/lane MCU (default PN532; PN7160, RC522, or PN5180 supported) | Automatic spool identification during lane preload | Load spool -> HH parks filament -> NFC scan-jog rotates spool -> Spoolman lookup -> HH gate map |
| Shared reader | One NFC reader mounted inside the MMU body (PN532, PN7160, RC522, or PN5180) | Fewer readers, manual tap before loading | Tap tag -> spool staged -> load any gate -> HH pregate preload -> staged spool assigned |
| Hybrid | Per-lane readers plus shared reader | Normal lanes with per-lane readers, plus shared/bypass workflows | Lane readers handle scan-jog; shared reader stages tapped spools for preload |

The shared reader can stage only a real Spoolman spool ID. UID lookup, embedded spool IDs, and auto-created Spoolman records work. Metadata-only tags without a Spoolman spool ID cannot be staged for Happy Hare preload.

## Requirements

- Voron/EMU setup running the [igiannakas IG-dev branch of Happy Hare](https://github.com/igiannakas/Happy-Hare/tree/IG-dev), which provides `variable_user_post_preload_extension`
- One Klipper MCU per filament lane for per-lane reader installs, or one MCU hosting the shared NFC reader
- Supported NFC reader hardware configured for its bus
- Hardware I2C or SPI bus on the MCU hosting the NFC reader
- Klipper version requirements:
  - Strongly recommended: use the latest Klipper on the host and every MCU
    hosting an NFC reader. The NFC drivers use Klipper's newer low-level
    `i2c_transfer` / `i2c_bus_status` path so bus errors such as `START_NACK`
    can be handled on the host side instead of turning reader faults into
    Klipper shutdowns.
  - If checking an older install, it should be newer than upstream commit
    `6bbc9069` (`bus: Note mcu code deprecation if missing i2c_transfer`,
    Feb 24, 2026 on GitHub).
  - After updating Klipper, rebuild and flash every MCU hosting an NFC reader.
- Spoolman reachable from the Pi
- NFC tags on spools: NTAG213/215/216, MIFARE Classic, or supported rich-tag formats
- Lane MCU firmware rebuilt from the same Klipper checkout as the host

## Happy Hare V4 Compatibility

Happy Hare v4 can run the post-preload hook while the MMU reports
`action=checking`. For automatic gate-status polling, NFC treats `checking` as
scan-safe only when the detected Happy Hare major version is 4 or newer. For
the post-preload hook, `_NFC_SCAN_JOG_PRELOAD` sends
`NFC GATE=<n> JOG_SCAN=1 SOURCE=AUTO`; that trusted hook path uses the same
version-aware scan-safe check: Happy Hare v4 accepts `action=idle` or
`action=checking`; Happy Hare v3/pre-v4 and unknown versions accept only
`action=idle`. Manual or console `JOG_SCAN=1` commands without `SOURCE=AUTO`
stay conservative and always require `action=idle`.

Happy Hare V4 also validates `MMU_SET_LED` effect names against its configured
operation effects. NFC therefore starts generated `[mmu_led_effect]` instances
directly on V4, while keeping the existing public `MMU_SET_LED` path on V3.
No LED configuration changes are required: define NFC effects with
`define_on: gates` (or `define_on: gates, exit`) as usual.

Supported readers:

| Reader | `reader_type` | Bus / address | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| PN532 | `pn532` | `36` (`0x24`) | Default reader and documented PN532 wiring path |
| PN7160 | `pn7160` | `40-43` (`0x28-0x2B`) | Supports NTAG/Type2, ISO15693/Type5, and authenticated Bambu/MIFARE reads |
| RC522 | `rc522` | SPI (`cs_pin` + `spi_bus`/software SPI pins) | UID lookup, NTAG/Type-2 rich reads, and authenticated MIFARE/Bambu reads; no ISO15693 |
| PN5180 | `pn5180` | SPI (`cs_pin`, `spi_bus`/software SPI pins, `busy_pin`, `reset_pin`) | ISO14443A/NTAG, authenticated MIFARE/Bambu, and SLIX2 (ISO15693/Type-5) reads; see the SLB nine-wire wiring guide |

Supported tag formats:

| Tag / data path | PN532 | PN7160 | RC522 | PN5180 | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Spoolman UID lookup | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Default path. The tag only needs a readable factory UID registered in Spoolman's extra field. |
| NTAG / NFC Type 2 rich tags | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | NDEF text/URI/MIME/JSON payloads, OpenSpool, OpenTag3D, TigerTag, OpenPrintTag text-compatible payloads, and several manufacturer binary tags. |
| MIFARE Classic rich tags | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Bambu, QIDI Box, and Creality CFS all require `tag_parsing: True` and `bambu_reads: True`. Bambu's own keys and Creality's UID-derived Key B both additionally require `pycryptodome`; QIDI uses a factory-default-key fallback that needs no extra dependency (see [Configuration Reference](docs/shared/configuration.md#tag-data-parsing)). |
| SLIX2 / ISO15693 Type 5 rich tags | No | Yes | No | Yes | Current Type-5 rich-read path is for SLIX2 tags. Its payload enters the normal parser and is not limited to OpenPrintTag. Official OpenPrintTag antenna size is best suited to a shared reader; per-lane use needs hardware testing. |

The vendored parser currently recognizes Bambu Lab, ELEGOO, Anycubic ACE,
TigerTag, Creality CFS/K1/K2, QIDI Box, SimplyPrint/QIDI URL tags, OpenTag3D,
OpenSpool, OpenPrintTag, and generic NDEF JSON filament records. See
[Spoolman Integration](docs/shared/spoolman-integration.md) for format details
and auto-create behavior. Bambu, TigerTag/TigerTag+, and tested Creality
CFS/K1/K2 rich tags also expose parser-derived same-spool `spool_identity`
values for scan-jog left-neighbor interference handling.

## Quick Install

Before installing, rebuild and flash Klipper firmware on every MCU that will host an NFC reader. Host and MCU firmware version mismatches produce I2C failures that look like wiring or reader problems.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/cwiegert/Happy-Hare-RFID-Reader.git rfid-reader
cd ~/rfid-reader
bash install.sh
```

Beta cutover note: if an old `~/emu-nfc-reader` install exists, the installer prompts before backing it up/removing it and continuing with a fresh `~/rfid-reader` install.

Add the includes to `printer.cfg` in this order.

Per-lane readers:

```ini
[include nfc/nfc_reader.cfg]
[include nfc/nfc_macros.cfg]
[include nfc/nfc_reader_hw.cfg]
```

Shared-reader-only:

```ini
[include nfc/nfc_reader.cfg]
[include nfc/nfc_macros.cfg]
[include nfc/nfc_reader_shared.cfg]
```

Hybrid:

```ini
[include nfc/nfc_reader.cfg]
[include nfc/nfc_macros.cfg]
[include nfc/nfc_reader_hw.cfg]
[include nfc/nfc_reader_shared.cfg]
```

Set Spoolman in `~/printer_data/config/nfc/nfc_reader.cfg`:

```ini
[nfc_gate]
spoolman_url:      auto
spoolman_rfid_key: rfid_tag
```

For shared-reader installs, wire Happy Hare's post-preload hook:

```ini
[gcode_macro _MMU_SEQUENCE_VARS]
variable_user_post_preload_extension: '_NFC_SHARED_PRELOAD'
```

Restart Klipper and run the doctor:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart klipper
```

```gcode
NFC_DOCTOR
NFC_STATUS
```

```

## Key Defaults

These are the defaults shipped in `config/nfc_reader.cfg`:

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `startup_polling` | `1` | Start polling after reader init succeeds |
| `poll_interval` | `10` | Per-lane background poll interval in seconds |
| `absent_threshold` | `3` | Missed polls before a removal event |
| `scan_enabled` | `False` | Disables automatic gate-status scan-jog trigger; manual/hook `JOG_SCAN` still works |
| `scan_jog_mm` | `150.0` | Logical scan chunk divided into three stopped-position substeps |
| `scan_jog_max` | unset | Optional fixed scan-jog travel limit; leave unset to use the lane Bowden length |
| `scan_reads_per_position` | `1` | Reads per stopped scan position |
| `scan_poll_interval` | `0.25` | Read spacing during scan-jog and shared-reader polling cadence |
| `scan_motion_mode` | `continuous` | `continuous` homes the forward search against the lane's virtual NFC endstop, stopping the instant the tag is detected; `stopped` keeps blocking substep reads |
| `scan_continuous_step_mm` | `150.0` | Continuous-mode forward chunk size. Rich reads use the observed UID hit-window center, so this no longer needs to be kept small for rich-tag positioning |
| `scan_continuous_speed` | `200.0` | Continuous-mode gear move speed |
| `scan_continuous_accel` | `2000.0` | Continuous-mode gear move acceleration |
| `scan_continuous_poll_interval` | `0.05` | In-flight NFC read cadence while a continuous chunk is estimated to be moving |
| `debug` | `2` | Warnings and errors in `nfc_reader.log` |
| `console_output` | `False` | Keep routine NFC logs out of the console |

To try continuous scan-jog:

```ini
[nfc_gate]
scan_motion_mode: continuous
scan_continuous_step_mm: 150.0
scan_continuous_speed: 200.0
scan_continuous_accel: 2000.0
scan_continuous_poll_interval: 0.05
```

Continuous mode preserves the existing tag-found flow: the read-light effect
plays for about 0.1 second, then NFC rewinds and dispatches the cached tag/spool
action just like stopped mode.
If a UID is found during motion, continuous mode waits for the current chunk to
finish and checks Spoolman first. If rich tag parsing is still needed, NFC
recenters to the observed UID hit-window center before running rich parsing and
the normal rich-read retry sweep.

Set `enabled: False` on a `[nfc_gate laneN]` or `[nfc_gate shared]` section to keep the config block in place without initializing hardware or registering commands for that reader.

## MCU Firmware Warning

The NFC reader driver talks to firmware running on the MCU, not only to Klipper on the Pi. After updating Klipper, rebuild and flash every lane/shared MCU that hosts an NFC reader before debugging NFC.

Recommended update order:

```text
1. Update the Klipper host checkout.
2. Build MCU firmware from that same checkout.
3. Flash every MCU that hosts an NFC reader.
4. Restart Klipper.
5. Confirm all MCUs reconnect before testing NFC.
```

When host and MCU firmware are out of sync, common symptoms include reader init failures, `i2c_read_response` timeouts, and other devices on the same I2C bus failing unexpectedly.
